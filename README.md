# *Neovim*

> [!Tip]
>
> Vim makes you really fast on writing code. Once you try, you don't wanna go back. And you can develop anything you want from it, because at the end of the day every code is just text.
>
> If you use Visual Studio Code and want to use Vim, there's actually [an extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscodevim.vim) in Visual Studio Code that simulates Vim on it. Go try it.

> [!Important]
> <b> *Setup Procedures..* </b>

To setup neovim with my files type the commands given below in your wsl or linux system : 


    git clone https://github.com/varshan-4068/Neovim-Setup.git 

    cd Neovim-Setup/ 

    cp -r nvim/ ~/.config/
    
    cd ~ 
    
    nvim 

That's it the neovim is setup perfectly with the needed plugins installed and if u wanna modify the setup as u wanted with my file feel free to do it..
